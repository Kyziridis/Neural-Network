# Neural-Network

This is a simple NN project written in Matlab (without a library) with only one hidden layer. 
It is for educational purpose, it was a university project in Machine_Learning.

The NN detect handwritten numbers which on mnist_data.

The main script is the 'demo_mnistLogreg.m' file which loads the data from the mnist_all.mat, split them to training_set and test_set, normalize the pixels to take values in [0,1] , and calls the other main functions such as costgrad_softmax, ml_softmax , etc.

The main purpose is to detect the handwritten numbers and this will done with multiple logistic regression which will classify the data we have.
